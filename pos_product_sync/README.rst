======================
 Sync Products in POS
======================

The module allows to instantly update product data in opened POSes via longpolling connection if any of predefined product fields have been changed in the backend.

By default, Odoo updates product data only when POS opens. This module allows keeping product data in POSes updated without reloading the POS.
